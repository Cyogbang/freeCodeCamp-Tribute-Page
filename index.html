            <quote style="font-style: italic;">“He basically helped save my party from terrible financial distress, so he was very kind to me personally. He was an immensely gifted man and I think he basically meant well. I know about all the trouble he had in his life and I hope he will be remembered for his contribution as an artist. I hope his children turn out well. That would be the greatest tribute you could have.”
